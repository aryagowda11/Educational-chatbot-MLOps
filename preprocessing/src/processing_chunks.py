    """
    Process audio chunks sequentially and combine results with continuous timestamps.
    
    This function:
    1. Lists and sorts all audio chunk files in the specified directory
    2. Iteratively processes each chunk:
       - Determines chunk duration
       - Transcribes audio using speech-to-text API
       - Adjusts timestamps based on accumulated time
       - Generates vector data for embeddings
       - Creates knowledge graph triples
    3. Combines results from all chunks into consolidated DataFrames
    4. Manages accumulated time to ensure continuous timestamps
    
    Args:
        chunks_dir (str): Directory containing audio chunks
        video_id (str): Identifier for the video
        course_id (str): Identifier for the course

    Process a complete video file through the preprocessing pipeline.
    
    This function orchestrates the entire video processing workflow:
    1. Evaluates the video size to determine optimal processing path
    2. For smaller videos: processes directly with standard transcription
    3. For larger videos:
       - Converts video to audio
       - Splits audio into manageable chunks
       - Processes each chunk in sequence
    4. Performs LLM-based text correction on transcriptions
    5. Post-processes text for final data quality
    6. Cleans up temporary files
