"""
Custom retrieval module for the GRAID application.
This module provides specialized vector store retrieval functions
that support semantic, temporal, and cached retrieval of context
related to educational video content.

Implementation details are masked for security and intellectual property protection.

    Retrieves semantically relevant context from a vector store based on query embeddings.
    
    This function:
    1. Creates filters to match specific course and video IDs
    2. Performs vector similarity search using the query embedding
    3. Retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the video content
    4. Returns concatenated text chunks as contextual information
    
    Args:
        vector_store: Vector database instance containing indexed video content
        video_id: Identifier for the specific video
