When we want to talk about classification, the idea is that the main change that we have is that y is no longer a real number, and it has k dimensions okay a better way saying it why it belongs to y1 to yk now what are those k is that imagine you want to solve a problem uh create a model that predicts or classifies breeds of the breed of a dog you know and all the breeds that you have those are going to be this yk. Now, k, this k are unique, that means that, you know, if you look at your"
